#  About The Project
This project was built to understand **Linux System Calls** and low-level string manipulation.
Unlike the standard implementation, this version:
 Does **NOT** use `<stdio.h>` or `printf`.
 Uses direct **kernel system calls** (`write`).
 Implements a custom string length algorithm (no `strlen`).
